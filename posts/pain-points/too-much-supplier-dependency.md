# Too much supplier dependency

When it comes to developing new solutions or concepts, it is common to rely on external suppliers, contractors, services, frameworks, and hosting. It helps reach the MVP faster and reduces the time to market. As it becomes more clear what our new solution/concept needs to be capable of, it also becomes more clear what technology or services it requires. Choosing the suppliers is not an easy task, even after a thorough assessment, and will require regular re-evaluation as the business grows and evolves. The more we know our business and solutions, the easier it will be to choose the best matching supplier.

## Let me explain it quickly

## Is your business limited by the supplier's capability?
The capabilities of your suppliers play a vital role in the success of your business. If your supplier lacks the necessary resources, technology, or expertise, it can become a bottleneck, complicating development and in the end limiting your ability to compete on the market. As your business grows and evolves, it is needed to reassess your supplier's capabilities regularly to ensure they align with the dynamic needs of your business.
## Are there any alternative suppliers? Is it a risk factor?
Some suppliers have unique offerings and these offerings can be exactly what is needed for your business to grow faster and easier. In such a case it is vital to evaluate the risk factor introduced with this strong binding to a single supplier.

A lot of services are offered by multiple suppliers in varying flavors, and evaluating the alternative suppliers and creating a risk mitigation plan is strongly recommended. Having multiple options not only reduces the risk of supply chain disruptions but also provides a better negotiation position.
## What will a switch to a different supplier cost? Is it possible at all?
When we access alternative suppliers, the focus is often what the new supplier can offer and at what cost, but how do we make the actual switch, is it even possible, and at what cost, are equally important areas to access. The overall evaluation is whether the benefits of switching outweigh the costs of the switch and if the transition aligns with your business goals.

When developing new services and concepts, it is worth spending some time evaluating the possible suppliers, identifying the possible risk factors, and defining a risk mitigation strategy if a supplier switch will be needed over time.

## Are you getting the focus from your supplier that your business needs?
The key with any supplier is communication and collaboration to ensure your business gets the focus and resources it needs. Any number of reasons can cause you to be sidelined or overlooked by the supplier. It could be that you are using a legacy system, your setup is overly complex, or the supplier is not aligned with your business objectives. In any case, it may be time to reassess the supplier and scout the landscape for an alternative supplier. A supplier in complex setups must collaborate on a strategic level and align their focus with your business objectives. 

## The suppliers are bought by a larger company or go bankrupt
Preventing mergers, acquisitions, and bankruptcy is just as hard as preventing forcemacure. These are things that are out of your hands, but you can prepare by having contingency plans in place to ensure minimal disruption to your business in such scenarios. Following the supplier's news reports and financial reports can indicate a potential risk. 


## Next step
If you can identify with any of these pain points, you have already taken the first step towards a future with a more resilient and agile business development strategy.

The next step is a deeper analysis of your business and supplier dependencies to recognize and address the challenges of the supplier dependencies. As an external professional with a fresh perspective, I can provide insights and strategies to navigate and mitigate the risks.
