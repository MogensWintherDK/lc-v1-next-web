# Long development time

When I speak with C-level executives their focus is on delivering new features, time to market, and staying competitive in a fast-moving market. With long development time and complex solutions, the edge position is quickly lost. It not only risks weakening the customer's interest but also puts the company at risk of losing potential revenue.

The way forward is to identify and eliminate the blocking pain points following the company's requirements for speed, quality, and cost.

## Common pain points for Long development time

### Is your development process limiting your business?
Development is a process, and this process does take time. Too long time and the market will be ahead and the moment of surprise will be lost, potential revenue lost. To be agile enough is the challenge. The limitations can be from too high complexity, insufficient project management, inefficient processes, and lack of automation and modern tools. When the full process from idea to release is not agile enough it limits the business instead of empowering it.

### Are your developers constantly overloaded with maintenance and operation?
When starting a company or a new service, there are no legacy and complicated processes in the baggage. A few years later the picture can be very different, and the joyful development process can quickly become more maintenance and operations. While deadlines for new features are still there, the time for implementing them is not, and this can build up unhealthy pressure and lead developers to burnout. Finding the balance between maintenance and development is crucial.

### Do you have the right combination of people in your organization?
As solutions develop and mature, the optimal team often changes as well, and it is easy to miss. When hiring new talent, it can be close to impossible to find one person with the right combination of skills and experience levels, and we have to settle with less than we hoped for. Rethinking the teams, roles, and skills is a complex process, but without it, it becomes challenging to tackle complex projects efficiently, impacting the development speed and potentially leading the project in the wrong direction. 

### Are existing developments undocumented?
Undocumented solutions and codebases are a common issue, and as the business and teams grow, it becomes a significant risk to continuity and scalability. Lack of proper documentation can lead to confusion and inefficiencies when working with existing codebases. Knowledge and understanding of the codebase and concepts can get lost, leading to a more complex and time-consuming onboarding of new team members. 

### Are your existing core solutions highly customized and therefore complex to develop?
While highly customized solutions may be perfect for specific needs, the risk is they increase the complexity of both development and maintenance. This complexity can result in longer development time and a higher likelihood of errors. Finding the right balance between customization and simplicity is crucial to both the development time, scalability, and the future of the solution.

## Next step
If you could identify with any of these pain points, you have already taken the first step towards a better future with more efficient development that aligns with your business goals.
