# Fragmented silo solutions

**Fragmented silo solutions: A barrier to business growth**

Fragmentation within the organization, services, and data all impact business development and agility negatively. When teams are isolated in silos and not pulling in the same direction, the result is often a lack of synergy, limited or overly complex integrations between systems, lack of knowledge sharing and limited communication, and challenges in reaching real data-driven business processes. In this article, some of the common pain points are explored a bit further, and strategies for breaking down the silos are discussed.

## Let me explain it quickly

## Are your teams not pulling in the same direction?
Working with multiple teams makes the business vastly more complex. Alignment between the teams ensures that all are pulling in the same direction. When each team have its own agenda and is sharing and understanding the common goal, then conflicts and reservation are commonly arising and silos are getting built. Ensuring that all teams work in the same direction is essential.
  
## Is there a lack of communication between teams?
No great collaboration exists without effective communication. Siloed teams often lack proper communication or communicate on different levels. The flow of information, sharing ideas, and understanding other team's views gets lost and enforces the silos even more. The good and open communication channels between teams are the foundation for breaking down the silos, knowing responsibilities, taking ownership, and respecting the other teams are also key elements in creating a cross-team collaboration culture.

## No or very little integration between solutions
Silos are not only related to the team but also to the solutions they develop and use. Lack of integration between solutions often results in additional and redundant work, no single source of truth, data inconsistencies between systems, and generally ineffective workflows where the tech is setting the limit rather than the business strategy. When designing solutions or choosing services, it is vital to ensure the solutions support integrations that streamline processes and improve overall productivity.

## Difficult to be data-driven
In a world where data is fundamental for running a business, serving customers, and growing the business, access to the right data at the right time is vital. When data is spread across siloed systems, it becomes challenging to utilize the full potential of the data. Breaking down the silos and creating a businesswide data strategy enables the business to make data-driven decisions with clarity and precision, and the focus can get back on the opportunities and not the limitations. Data must empower the business, not limit it.

##  Territorial protection and team-centric focus
The longer developers have worked in siloed teams, the more team-centric the focus can become, and it may foster a mindset of territorial protection and team-centric focus. Developers may entrenched in their specific domain, guarding their experience and resources. This will further enforce the silos, leading to less communication and collaboration. 

The same behavior can be seen when teams are overloaded over longer periods. In the protection of the team, a barrier is formed around the team to limit the interruptions and noise from the rest of the company, and a new team silo is created.

An often misunderstood curtesy is to leave such teams out of early discussions and design work, not to interrupt, and the result may be built around the team and not with the team, and a new solution/integration silo was created.

A focus on the processes of the team, their responsibilities, and cross-team cooperation is needed to start breaking the barriers and fostering a collaborative working culture that in time leads to enhanced productivity and a more agile business.

## Next step
If you can identify with any of these pain points, you have already taken the first step towards a future with a more collaborative and agile business.

The next step is a deeper analysis of your teams, processes, workflows, solutions, integrations, and suppliers to recognize and address the challenges of fragmented silo solutions. As an external professional with a fresh perspective, I can provide insights and strategies to navigate and solve silo challenges.
