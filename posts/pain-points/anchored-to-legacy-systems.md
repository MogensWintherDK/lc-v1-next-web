# Anchored to Legacy Systems

**Anchored to Legacy Systems: Navigating the Challenges of Outdated Technology**

An organization's reliance on legacy systems causes large challenges that block business growth and limit innovation. In this article, some of the common pain points related to legacy systems are explored.

## Are your solutions built on older tech that is hard to migrate away from?
Legacy systems, while once robust and reliable, can be an anchor holding your business back. Rewriting the solution using modern technology seems like a no-brainer, but getting from old to new can be a tricky journey. Legacy systems often contain outdated concepts, workflows, and security risks, so making a 1-1 rewrite often makes less sense. 
Getting the big picture and reevaluating the concepts is often the most time-consuming process. Migration planning is the next time-consuming process, what parts can be migrated, what is it integrated with, and what data is affected? One big-bang update, or small upgrade iterations?

## Will a migration of a legacy code base cause a full stop of new development?
There is never a good time for migrating legacy systems and your development teams most likely have plenty of new development to focus on. The balance between modernizing your system and ensuring continuous business growth is a delicate but necessary undertaking. In often case it is the same designers, developers, and QA that is involved in both.

The golden middle way can be complex to balance, and just coming to a conceptual migration plan based on the big-picture view often requires time from the most senior designers and developers. 

## Migration of live systems and data
The migration of larger and more complex legacy systems always comes with the fear of disruption of live processes and data. The balance between migrating and ensuring continuous business operations is a delicate but necessary undertaking. While designing the new system principles can be used to mitigate the risk of breaking live systems and corrupting live data.
## Will a migration from a legacy system to a modern system be worth it?
Estimating the ROI of a migration from a legacy system to a modern one is essential. While the migration itself might seem costly, it is important to also include the long-term benefits, such as faster development, less maintenance, increased efficiency, scalability, and reduced technical debt just to mention a few. 

## Are you missing the big-picture perspective required to build a new solution?
Understanding the past is required to build the future, and the more complex a migration you stand in front of, the greater understanding is required of the business logic, concepts, data structure, integrations, and external requirements.

With the big picture in place, the conceptual design of the future can be created. It must be a design "of the future", in the sense that the foundation and limitations set now define the guidelines for the future. A greater understanding of business processes, user experience, future scaling, and the overall company vision is critical. Weak concepts may lead to missed business options in the future.

## Can you leap forward?
Innovation often requires bold moves, so consider whether your migration plan reassesses your concepts and includes the foundation for future business requirements. Rather than small incremental steps, envision a transformation that aligns with your business goals and ensure your solution is future-proof. It is a delicate balance, small steps vs a leap, and leaps are not for everyone.

Innovation often requires bold moves. Consider whether your migration plan is comprehensive enough to propel your organization forward. Rather than incremental steps, envision a transformation that aligns with your business goals and ensures that your technology infrastructure is future-proof.

## Build your new system landscape on an ecosystem
Choosing a platform or ecosystem can revolutionize your system landscape. Building on a unified platform ensures seamless integrations and simplified management of your tech stack. 

Evaluating the platform or ecosystem to ensure it supports all the requirements of today and the expected requirements of the future is critical, as well as estimating the overall cost.

Larger platforms and ecosystems often have a greater community and support system. Hiring new skilled developers is commonly easier for the more popular modern platforms and ecosystems.

## Next step
If you can identify with any of these pain points, you have already taken the first step towards a future with modern technology and less legacy.

The next step is a deeper analysis of your teams, processes, workflows, solutions, integrations, and suppliers to recognize and address the challenges of legacy migration. As an external professional with a fresh perspective, I can provide insights and strategies to navigate a legacy migration.

Together we can take the next step.
