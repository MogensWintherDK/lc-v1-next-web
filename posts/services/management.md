## Management
**Are you missing a CTO or team lead for a period of time?**

Changes happens to all organizations and sometimes we need a quick solution to an urgen problem. If you are missing a CTO or a strong team lead for a period of time, it can be a smart move to have me jump in and full the role while you search for the permanent cndidate.

**Experience**

My expieriende in a fast growing online industry as CTO, leader and mentor allow to quickly take over smaller teams for a limited period of time.

**The perminent candidate**

When the permanent candidate has been found, I can also assist in the interview process to ensure the right candidate is chosen.
