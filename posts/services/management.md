## Management

**Are you missing a CTO or team lead for some time?**

Changes happen to all organizations and sometimes we need a quick solution to an urgent problem. If you are missing a CTO or a strong team lead for some time, it can be a smart move to have me jump in and fill the role while you search for a permanent candidate.

**Experience**

My experience in a fast-growing online industry as CTO, leader, and mentor allows me to quickly take over smaller teams for a limited period.

**The permanent candidate**

When the permanent candidate has been found, I can also assist in the interview process to ensure the right candidate is chosen.
