# Migration

**Are you heading against a Cloud migration, or merging multiple applications?**

## _Migrating to the Cloud_

Applications and services built in the Cloud and for the Cloud are often straightforward to handle.

On-site application migration can be tricky and requires more planning, structure, and understanding. 

In this process, it can be a great benefit to review the actual application, its use, and requirements. During the lifetime of an application, these parameters often change, and if we are going to spend time migrating the application we should also focus on the application itself.

> An application not designed for the cloud can be quite complex to migrate

I have a lot of experience with dockerizing applications and services, both for the development and production process. I have been running most applications in the Cloud since 2009, mainly at AWS and later on at Google Cloud and others.

## _Merging multiple services/applications_

After the company merger, changes in operational flows, and a lot of other cases we can be in a situation where multiple systems/services/applications need to be migrated into a single existing or new solution. 

Migrations like this require good planning, understanding of the data, structure, and testing. In most cases, live data are involved, ensuring the single source of truth.
