# Perspective

**When we know where to go and how to get there, it is just a walk in the park.**

But the reallity of often very different, as we might have a strategy from a few years back where the conditions or market was different, so what do we do now?

## _Big picture_

I always operate with the big picture. For me that means that I need to understand the entire process/flow of the service I work on. I do not need to know every detail, but I on a mediun-to-high level.

**Take it to the sky, and bamck again**

When I create designs I think further then just the version/mvp we are setout to build. I think how it can scale, grow and evolve. So in the thinking process I take it to the sky, and when it can scale to such a size, I take it back to earth again. With this big picture I can then makes the best decissions for the design and I can prioritize what needs to be created now and what can wait for later.

## _A dot on the horizon_

Most developers, QA, project managers etc, loose focus on the actual task if you share the full big picture with them at once, so instead I provide a teaser of it, an indication of where the future will bring us, that is _the dot on the horizon_ they need. It gives the perspective that we are working on something bigger, and we can keep focus on the task at hand.
