# Perspective

**When we know where we are heading and how to get there, it is just a walk in the park.**

But the reality is often very different, as we might have a strategy that was last updated a few years ago when the conditions and market were different, so should we go right or left?

## _Big picture_

I always operate with the big picture, based on a deep understanding of the entire process/flow of the service. I do not need to know every detail, but I need a medium-to-high level.

**Take it to the sky, and back again**

When I create a system design I think much further than just the first version or the MVP we are set out to build. I think about how it can scale, grow and evolve. In the thinking process, I take it to the sky, and when it can scale to such a size, then I take it back to earth. With this big picture defined,  I can make the best decisions for the design and prioritize what needs to be implemented now and what to save for later.

## _A dot on the horizon_

Most developers, QA, project managers, etc., lose focus on the actual task if presented with the full big picture at once, so providing a teaser of it, an indication of where it will be in a year or two, that is _the dot on the horizon_ they need. It gives the perspective of working on something bigger and keeps focus on the task at hand.
