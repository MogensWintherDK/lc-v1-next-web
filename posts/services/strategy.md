# Strategy

Creating the strategy for your business is a process normally handled by the management, and can for good reason not be outsourced.

## Help to technical aspects
In cases where a larger technical solution is involved in the vision, and there are a large number of unknowns on the big picture, it can be an idea to pressure test the concept on a theoretical level or create prototypes to prove critical elements.

## Implementing the strategy
A strategy can be pretty clear on a business level, but hard to imagine implemented on a technical level. In cases like this, it can be valuable to get an outsider's perspective on the suggested implementation.

## Need help
I have created and worked with strategies and visions a lot and I am happy to help.
