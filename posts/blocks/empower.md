# Empower the team

**I strongly believe in empowering peeple**

In most cases I believe in empowering peopel to solve the problems on their own. This helps them grow and enables them to solve the next complex issue on their own.

**The big picture**

I like to challende people on their big picture, and step-by-step make their picture larger and larger.

**Learning requires time**

But there is a balance, and as learning takes time and requires a bit of air and headspace. If the challenges we work with are huge and all capacity is already used, we can not just added more, then we will automated, reduce, restructure to win time and then focus on the learning.
