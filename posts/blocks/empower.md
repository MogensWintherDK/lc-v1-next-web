# Empower the team

**I strongly believe in empowering people**

I believe in empowering people to solve the problems on their own. This helps them grow and enables them to solve the next complex issue on their own.

**The big picture**

I like to challenge people on their big picture, and step-by-step make their picture larger and larger. This process allows people to grow with the idea and form their mental big picture.  Without that, they will struggle to understand the vision and direction.

**Learning requires time**

We all know that earning takes time and requires a bit of air and headspace. If the challenges we work with are huge and all capacity is already used, we can not just add more, then we will automate, reduce, restructure to create needed time and space for learning.
