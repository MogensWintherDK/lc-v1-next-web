# Drop me in the chaos...

**We all experience some technical chaos in our businesses over time. Most we can handle on our own, but how fast and at what cost?**

I have a technical background, have been growing in management over the years and for the last 10+ years been a hands-on CTO. I can analyze and design large and complex solutions, explain them to the developers, and also present the results to clients and the C-level.

My experience comes from working as a developer and software designer creating software for mobile network equipment, network routers, distributed systems, and up to high-scale cloud services. Founded two successful startups, and ran multiple teams.

I am a team player with good communication skills and a structured approach to my work. For the last 10+ years, I have worked with several international companies and thrive well in this arena.

Do you need help with the chaos, or would you like my advice?
