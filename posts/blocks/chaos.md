# Drop me in the chaos...

**We can all find ourself in situations where we need to get technical issues fixed, get a new perspective on how to fix them, and need a hand to get there.**

Drop me in the chaos and I will help you through the process.
My process is:
- Get a fast overview
- Understand the goal
- Take a deeper dive
- Define the horizon
- Define the strategy
- Create a step-by-step plan
- Execute the plan with the team
- Evaluate the result
- Repeat if needed
- Handover

With my backgroud as a developer, system designer, CTO and manager, I am ready to jump in on all levels.
