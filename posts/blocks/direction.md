# Direction

Having a clearly defined strategy and vision as a company is the perfect situation. Then we have the big lines drawn for us already, and all can pull in the same direction.

**It is easy to lose focus of the direction when your head is in the mud all day**

When things are not so clearly defined people tend to keep focus on what is in front of them, focus on themself rather than the team or company.

A fresh perspective and a clear direction help teams perform great again.

**A defined dot in the horizon is a good start**

Until we have our strategy and vision in place, defining a dot on the horizon can help development teams a lot. It provides a beakon for guidance, and often makes the developers make smarter choices.

Not long ago I spoke with a lead developer, in a company needing a defined direction, who said:
> We are ready to build anything now, the team has been working great lately, but we just don't know what to build next
