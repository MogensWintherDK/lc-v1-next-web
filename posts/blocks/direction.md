# Right direction

**It is easy to loose focus of the direction when your head is in the mud all day**

A fresh perspective and a clear direction and help teams perform great again.

**Have a defined horizon**

On a business level we can have a great strategy for our business, and it is defenetly needed.

What could a definition of a horizon be:
> Over a period of time we need our solution to be cloud-based and migrating all applications to docker.
> Some more 
> Some more

Not long ago I spoke with a lead developer who said:
> We are ready to build anything now, the team has been working great lately, but we just don't know what to build next

A clear lack of long term planing and direction.
