# Pricing
**A fair price is always a balance between what is expected and what is delivered!**

And when measuring the cost, the gain in value for the company should be larger than the cost of the investment, then it is a good investment and you make your "Money grow".

I think the pricing here is quite fair, and remember as you hire a consultant, you don't have overhead on the cost of pension, sick days, vacation, social benefits, and so on. 

## Model 1 - Step by step

| Step | Cost ex VAT | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Initial analysis | 6.000 EUR | Initial analysis of the project scope and creation of an action plan and SOW during 2 weeks |
| Execution | 2.500 EUR/Week | Following weeks implementing and evaluating the action plan |


## Model 2 - Monthly
A monthly hire has a fixed cost and no startup fee.
|Timeframe | Cost ex VAT | Description |
|-|-|-|
| 1-3 months | 10.000 EUR/month | Short term monthly cost |
| 3+ months | 8.000 EUR/month | Long term monthly cost |

## On-site and travel cost
On-site work is expected in the startup of most projects.

Additional cost:
