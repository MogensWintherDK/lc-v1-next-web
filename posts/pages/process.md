# My process

**Drop me in the chaos and I will help you through the process**
This is kind of my mantra, and based on this I use my experience, skills, and structure to make order in the chaos. Create processes for the teams and a clear direction to follow.

My process is like this:

- Get a fast overview
- Understand the goal of the process
- Take a deeper dive and create the analysis
- Create and agree on the action plan with the stakeholders
- Execute the plan with the team
- Evaluate the results with the stakeholders
- Prepare the next iteration if needed
- Handover to the teams
- Debrefe with the stakeholder

With my background as a software developer, system designer, CTO, and manager, I have been through this process a lot of times.

**Management or hands-on**
I can be a Managing Consultant only, or help with deeper levels of coding as needed. For me, it is just a puzzle, and I want each piece handled by the best-suited person, and then I can take the rest.
