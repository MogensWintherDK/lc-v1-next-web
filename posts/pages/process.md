# Process

**It is my experience that every project is different and that there is no one-fit-all process model. What is also my experience is the need for a clear statement of work so everyone is aligned with the scope, deliverables, and schedule.**

My process is based on this template

- **Step 1 - Initial analysis**
    - Get a fast overview
    - Get to know the involved parties
    - Understand the background and goal of the process
    - Take a deeper dive and create the analysis
    - Create and agree on the action plan, the SOW, with the stakeholders

- **Step 2 - Execution**
    - Execute the plan with the team
    - Evaluate the results with the stakeholders
    - Handover to the teams
    - Debrief with the stakeholder

With my background as a software developer, system designer, CTO, and manager, I have been through this process a lot of times in different variations, both working internally internally and in cooperation with external companies.

## Statement of Work (SOW)
A clear action plan is needed and the SOW document is exactly that.

The content of the SOW includes
- Purpose - Why are we doing the project
- Scope of work - A detailed description of the work to be done
- Location of work - A description of where the work takes place, including meetings
- Period of performance - A specification of the timeframe for the project
- Deliverables schedule - A list of elements and their due date

**Management or hands-on**

I can be a Managing Consultant only, or help with deeper levels of coding as needed. For me, it is just a puzzle, and I want each piece handled by the best-suited person, and then I can take the rest.
