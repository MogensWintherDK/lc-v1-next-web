# My process

**Drop me in the chaos and I will help you through the process**
This is kind of my mantra, and based on this I use my experience, skills and structure to make order in the chaos. Create processes for the teams and a clear direction to follow.

My process is like is:

- Get a fast overview
- Understand the goal of the process
- Take a deeper dive and create the analyzis
- Create and agree on the action plan with the stakeholder
- Execute the plan with the team
- Evaluate the results with the stakehodler
- Prepare the next iteration if needed
- Handover to the teams
- Debrefe with the stakeholder

With my backgroud as a sodtware developer, system designer, CTO and manager, I have been through this process a lot of times.

**Management or hands-on**
I can be a Managing Consultant only, or help with deeper levels on coding as needed. For me the it is just a puzzle, and I want each piece handled by the best suited person, and then I can take the rest.
